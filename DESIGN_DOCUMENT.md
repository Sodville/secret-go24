# SECRET

a 2D puzzle-platformer with exploration and roguelite elements

- **Ganre:** Athmospheric platformer
- **Platform:** win/linux, partially web
- **Target audience:** speedrunners, roguelite enjoyers


## High-level Concept
Players will navigate through dark levels and use what little light they have navigate through the level and reach the end.
Each attempt teaches the player a little about the layout of the map allowing them to make better decisions.

The game incentivices exploration and discovering new *secrets*.

## Gameplay
- smooth platforming
- puzzles
- exploration
- collection
- multiple characters

### Character ideas
- Illuminator guy (can light up areas on demand)
- Parkour person (faster and more agile, maybe double jump or croutch or smth)
- Sensing guy (can focus to sense danger nearby)
- Engineer / janitor (can repair or sabotage broken electronics)
- Silent Killer (brings X bullets to kill enemies in our path)

## Art and Aesthetics

We want a very limited color palette because of the [wildcards](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024). And it'd be cool if the game was drawn with a similar technique to [roguelight](https://managore.itch.io/roguelight) which encapsulate the play with light very well.

## Technicical Req

### Dev tools
- zig
- raylib
- tiled (for level design)

**Note:** the game should be entirely determenistic such that players can feel consistent and rewarded for it.

## UI
TODO

## MUSIC
TODO

## Multiplayer
Really want to add multiplayer after a while. Won't focus on it until we are confident the game is functionaly complete for single player.
